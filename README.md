# Evaluation of Perturbation-based Explanation Methods for Node Classification

This repository provides all the code from the Bachelor Thesis "Evaluation of Perturbation-based Explanation Methods for Node Classification"
All experiments are executed with the code found in the src-folder. 

In train_2.py all models are trained
In gnnexplainer_ptg_sparse.py the GNNExplainer is applied to the trained models
In main_explain_2.py the CF-GNNExplainer is applied to the trained models

The baseline is taken from the repository of the official implementation of the [AISTATS 2022 paper CF-GNNExplainer: Counterfactual Explanations for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03322).
