# CF-GNNExplainer: Counterfactual Explanations for Graph Neural Networks

This repository provides all the code from the Bachelor Thesis "Evaluation of Perturbation-based Explanation Methods for Node Classification"
Its baseline is taken from the repository of the official implementation of the [AISTATS 2022 paper CF-GNNExplainer: Counterfactual Explanations for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03322).
